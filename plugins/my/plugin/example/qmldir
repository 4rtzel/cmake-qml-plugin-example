# Module name.
# Make sure module name coincides with module import path.
# For example: path to our module is my/plugin/example and module name
# is my.plugin.example
module my.plugin.example

# Plugin name.
# Make sure that is the same name as your library target in
# CMakeLists.txt
plugin myplugin

# Resourse files
# 'qmldir' syntax for resources is:
# <ResourceIdentifier> <InitialVersion> <File>
# With 'qrc:' you can tell Qt to look for files in memory and it's
# required way for us because these files will be in 'myplugin' resources.
MyQml 1.0 qrc:/plugin/MyQml.qml
MyScript 1.0 qrc:/plugin/MyScript.js

# 'plugin.qmltypes' is autogenerated files for IDEs (such as Qt Creator)
# to understand dependencies of plugin and property that plugin exports.
# File was autogenerated with 'qmlplugindump' although it is possible
# to write it by hands.
typeinfo plugin.qmltypes
